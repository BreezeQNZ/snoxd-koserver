          <h3>Welcome to Snoxd's community KO server project.</h3>

<p>Unless you guys start pitching in too, this isn't going to go anywhere. I can easily continue working on my own private project; if you want an up-to-date server that actually works, you can help write it too. I accept that there's going to be leeching, but NO active contributors WHATSOEVER? </p>

<p>The whole point of the interest thread was to see whether this was remotely worth undertaking. Only <em>ONE</em> of those few that said they'd contribute have stuck around and contributed a couple of things (thanks rawf). The others? If you are unable to help, <em>DO NOT SAY THAT YOU CAN</em>.</p>

<p>This has thus far been a complete waste of my time. So either help, or this public project dies - along with what's left of public PSKO development... you really are shooting yourselves in the foot here. This is the absolute perfect opportunity to get things moving with PSKO - with full control by yourself. You don't need to be an assembly programmer to mess with anything... you don't have to buy things off people (or contract them).</p>

<p>The server is WHOLLY in your control. And again, you choose to ignore this opportunity and simply leech... very incomplete files: unless YOU put in the effort to make them otherwise.</p>

<p>The ball is now in your court.</p>

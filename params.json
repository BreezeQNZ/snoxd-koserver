I can easily continue working on my own private project; if you want an up-to-date server that actually works, you can help write it too. I accept that there's going to be leeching, but NO active contributors WHATSOEVER? \r\n\r\nThe whole point of the interest thread was to see whether this was remotely worth undertaking. Only _ONE_ of those few that said they'd contribute have stuck around and contributed a couple of things (thanks rawf). The others? If you are unable to help, _DO NOT SAY THAT YOU CAN_.\r\n\r\nThis has thus far been a complete waste of my time. So either help, or this public project dies - along with what's left of public PSKO development... you really are shooting yourselves in the foot here. This is the absolute perfect opportunity to get things moving with PSKO - with full control by yourself. You don't need to be an assembly programmer to mess with anything... you don't have to buy things off people (or contract them).\r\n\r\nThe server is WHOLLY in your control. And again, you choose to ignore this opportunity and simply leech... very incomplete files: unless YOU put in the effort to make them otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe ball is now in your court.","google":"","tagline":"Snoxd community KO server project.

I can easily continue working on my own private project; if you want an up-to-date server that actually works, you can help write it too. I accept that there's going to be leeching, but NO active contributors WHATSOEVER? \r\n\r\nThe whole point of the interest thread was to see whether this was remotely doing. Only ONE of those few have stuck around and contributed a couple of things (thanks rawf). The others? If you are unable to help, DO NOT SAY THAT YOU CAN.\r\n\r\nThis has thus far been a complete waste of my time. So either help, or this public project dies - along with what's left of public PSKO development.","note":"Don't delete this file!
